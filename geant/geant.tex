\section{Introduction}
GEANT was developed by Rene Brun of CERN in the 1974 as well (it was a good time for programming).


\section{Learning Projects}
Your goal in this section will be to design a calorimeter for a fixed target experiment that has a resolution for jets that is better than
$$
{\sigma \over E} = {0.8 \over \sqrt{E}}
$$
a resolution for electrons of better than
$$
{\sigma \over E} = {0.13 \over \sqrt{E}}
$$
and is as cheap as possible.  You should use materials (with prices)
from Table
