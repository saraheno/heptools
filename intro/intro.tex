At this point in the course, you should be comfortable with
Linux, C++, and root, and you should be beginning to understand
why continuing to learn more about programming is essential for most
careers in science.

In this part of the course, we are going to learn two very sophsticated
computational tools that are used extensively by the experimental
high energy physics community, PYTHIA8 and GEANT4.
These tools, written initially in FORTRAN but now in C++,
were developed over
the course of decades, and involved input from hundreds of
physicists (albeit often with one lead author).  

PYTHIA8 is used almost exclusively by high energy physicists.
GEANT4, however, has wide applications, in high energy physics,
cosmology,
particle astrophysics, health physics, plasma physics, and medical physics.
Both, however, will serve to introduce you to the type of
large code systems used in many fields of physics and engineering.

Of course, during this semester, we will only be able to touch
on the wide range of options and applications of these programs.
To really know them well, most people need a few years of constant
use.

The web sites for these programs can be found at

\item PYTHIA 8:  http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html  and
